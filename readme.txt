This plugin integrates [shipcloud](https://www.shipcloud.io/en/lp/woocommerce?utm_campaign=plugindescription&utm_source=wordpress_en&utm_medium=woocommerce) into WooCommerce.

== Description ==

shipcloud is the only shipping service provider you need! 
With this plugin you can create shipping labels for all popular carriers in Germany right out of the WooCommerce admin panel. Without the need to copy or upload your order data into another external system (no CSV upload necessary). 
The direct connection to shipcloud allows you to print out the shipping label directly. In addition, you get free tracking of your parcels, so that you always have an overview of where your orders are at the moment.

= All the benefits shipcloud offers you =
